# Why this does fork exist?

I have a somewhat of a love-hate relationship with warnings... This original project hasn't been touched in over a year (from when I originally forked it). It has warnings. Nothing was broken, and nothing was deprecated. But when I was learning go and I did a go build and would constantly see this output, it was making me crazy. So I checked it out, to fix it. Because I made some major changes on the [`watgbridge`](https://codeberg.org/coco_code_github_forks/watgbridge) fork of mine from the original. And I needed some sanity.

# Pull request into the original?

Sure, go for it!

I just don't have the time or patience to make things work with configuration. I don't have a lot of time as it is. So, if you wanna help out, please cherry pick my stuff and make a PR on the original. It would be much more beneifical that way.
